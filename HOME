We are ARS Team. We were part of the first Hackathon hosted in Kosovo, specifically in Prizren, named CoderGals. Our task was to create a plug-in for JSCommunicator using Laravel, which is a framework for Php.
JSCommunicator is a WebRTC communication tool developed in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It supports voice, video and chat messaging using the SIP protocol over WebSockets.
JSCommunicator is a free software licensed under the GNU General Public License v2.0. There is no requirement for plugins and no lock-in to a particular service provider.
Other free software projects such as the DruCall plugin for Drupal choose JSCommunicator to limit exposure to the complexity of SIP.
One of the challenges we encountered during this task was how to create a plug-in for WebRTC with Laravel, which was never done before. After numerous attempts we managed to figure that out and do it.
